# Chocolatey Package for SpecFlow

This directory contains the Chocolatey package configuration for SpecFlow.

## Installation

### From GitHub Releases

Download the latest `.nupkg` file from [releases](https://github.com/maneeshchaturvedi/homebrew-specflow/releases) and install:

```powershell
# Navigate to the directory containing the .nupkg file
choco install specflow-cli -s . -y
```

### Manual Download and Install

```powershell
# Download the .nupkg file
$version = "1.1.0-alpha"  # Replace with desired version
$url = "https://github.com/maneeshchaturvedi/homebrew-specflow/releases/download/v$version/specflow-cli.$version.nupkg"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile "specflow-cli.$version.nupkg"

# Install from local file
choco install specflow-cli -s . -y
```

## Verify Installation

```powershell
specflow --version
```

## Upgrade

```powershell
# Download the new version .nupkg file and run:
choco upgrade specflow-cli -s . -y
```

## Uninstall

```powershell
choco uninstall specflow-cli -y
```

## Package Maintenance

The package is automatically generated by the CI/CD pipeline when a new release is created in the main [specflow repository](https://github.com/maneeshchaturvedi/specflow).

### Package Structure

- `specflow.nuspec` - Package metadata and dependencies
- `tools/chocolateyinstall.ps1` - Installation script
- `tools/chocolateyuninstall.ps1` - Uninstallation script

### How It Works

1. The CI/CD pipeline builds Windows binaries and uploads them to GitHub releases
2. The Chocolatey package is generated with references to the binary URLs
3. When users install via Chocolatey, it downloads the binary from GitHub releases
4. The install script places the `specflow.exe` in the Chocolatey tools directory
